            here included maintenance of our current site, and the development of new sites using new technologies we, as a company, were exploring. It was then that I started 
            working with Angular in a professional capacity for a while, before moving on and spending a few months learning React.`,

            in NextJS as part of my Portfolio. I also continued my work in Illustrator and Photoshop, along with 3D animation and video editing techniques

        this system for over a year. My role eventually expanded to include maintenance of several subsites, built with a variety of technologies, from .Net Core, Razor Pages/C#
        and Angular. In 2021 I resumed my training with React, and I now maintain and develop new features using NextJS. I have also kept my previous duties, maintaining the other 
        sites with C#, Angular and now React.`,
